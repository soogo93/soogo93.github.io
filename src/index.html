        <h1>Photographer</h1>
      </header>
      <p>I am a photographer who spends as much time shooting and editing photographs as breathing. I primarily work with travel &amp; landscape, but have been known to dabble in action–sport and street photography in the past. </p>
      <p>I go on regular microadventures in order to access remote locations; these are often grueling exercises in some bad conditions all for one shot - <em>if</em> the light is right. </p>

        <h1>Adventurer</h1>
      </header>
      <p>The best photo's have a story behind them. They say a photo can tell a thousand words; but it can't tell every detail of what it took to achieve it. </p>
      <p>After an adventure I try to tell the story through both words and photos, giving the lows and the highs to try and get across what they're really like, why I do it, and to inspire others to follow suit. It's these stories that populate my <em><a href="/adventures-photography" title="Photostories from the front lines">adventures and photography</a></em> pages.

        <h1>Developer</h1>
      </header>
      <p>I develop clean and maintainable code for my own projects and my employer. I work in a number of languages including C#, Python, and Ruby. I also have experience with web frameworks such as Django and ASP.net.</p>
      <p>I regularly share what I am working on through my GitHub profile to help others learn and contribute towards projects. For example, you can find the source-code for this website in it's <a href="http://github.com/danielgroves/danielgroves.net" title="Source code for danielgroves.net">open–source repository</a>. </p>
