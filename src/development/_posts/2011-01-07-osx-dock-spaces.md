A few people recently have been asking how I achieved the spaces in my dock, see the video below for details.  The commands follow so you can copy &amp; paste them.

Do this once for every space you want: <tt>defaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add '{"tile-type"="spacer-tile";}'</tt>

Followed by this to make them appear: <tt>killall Dock</tt>
