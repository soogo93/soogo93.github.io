title: Business Cards
excerpt: A preview of my new business cards, some thoughts on the Moo service, and 10% off

After deciding I would like to do more freelance work I figured it was time I started to try and make better use of networking events such as [DigPen][1] in order to spread my name around. This, in truth, is part of the reason I decided to redesign my portfolio website recently; I didn't feel I should try and sell myself on things that I've not even found time to put into practice on my own website.

As part of this I recently decided to get some business cards printed which have arrived with plenty of time to spare for [DigPen][1].

These cards are the *Luxe* model from [Moo][2]. They provided great service and delivered before the predicted date, keeping me up–to–date with frequent emails from *"Little MOO"* — the *print robot*.

The [Moo][2] service was great, right from when I requested more details about the exact shade of blue they used in the blue *Luxe* cards through to doing a quality–control check on my cards before sending them to print. Without these little steps I wouldn't have felt so confident with sending them to print; this being the first time I've done any print design before.

Overall, I couldn't recommend [Moo][2] enough, great quality with fantastic customer service; for 10% off you can [use this referral link][2].
