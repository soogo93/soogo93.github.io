This page was inspired by the [/now][now_movement] movement. The idea here is to maintain a /now page which explains what you're working on right now.

## Primary Focuses

* **Photography**: I'm trying to push my photography forward with a view to selling prints.
* **Adventures**: I love getting out and seeing the world, so I'm [focusing on lots of microadventures][adventures_photography] with bigger ones in the pipeline for the near future.
* **Big Adventure**: I'm getting ready to leave for a big adventure on June 5th. The adventure is called [Eurovelo][eurovelo], and is a 4500km cycle ride across Europe to raise money for charity.
* **Reading**: I love books, so I'm reading as many as I can.
* **Writing**: I'm trying to write new and fresh content for this website. It's grown a little too stale for my liking in certain areas, so I'd like to get more frequent content rolling forward.
* **Code**: I'm working on a project, which will be open-sourced in the near future. More details coming soon.

## One liner about what you do

I write software to pay the bills so that I can go on adventures and inspire others to do the same through photography and storytelling.

## Why do you do what you do?

I love the process of producing things that others can enjoy; weather that is to build life-changing software or to inspire others to leave technology behind and get outside. Photography is a particularly appealing activity because it combines everything I love; being outdoors, inspiring others and producing a final results that other can truly enjoy. In a world where everything is becoming digital it's nice to be working on something that, at the end of the process, I can actually enjoy as a physical artifact.

## Recent thought or epiphany

> A great landscape does not make a great picture, and a great picture does not make a great landscape.

## Recommended book or article

[*Racing Through the Dark: The Fall and Rise of David Millar* by David Millar][recommended_book] is a fascinating insight into the true qualities of professional road racing, the pressures that some with it and the internal drug abuse culture. A fascinating read that I can thoroughly recommend.
