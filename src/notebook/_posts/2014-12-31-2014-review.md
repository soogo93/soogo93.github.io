The last twelve months have been busy and productive. Software projects have been started, written and shipped, while sport-challenges have been planned and completed.

As the year started I was mid-way through the final year of my degree. I'd just started writing the code for Server Observer, and within a few months I had beta testers actively using the service. By April it was finished enough for my degree, so I proceeded to write the rather hefty dissertation to go with it during April and early May. The project saw me take a steep learning curve and pick-up multiple new technologies; Python, PostgreSQL, Redis, Django, Ansible and the Twilio API just to name a few.

Since this date I have made the decision to kill-off the hosted project and open-source everything with the hope of others helping push this foreword in the right direction.

Thanks to months of hard work I am glad to say this project saw me walk straight into a job with Vualto after university and then graduate in September.

The summer was busy; after accepting my job I had just a week to find and sign the contract for a flat before going on holiday for two weeks and starting work the day after my return. Just three weeks later I was off again with a university friend to cycle from John O' Groats to Lands End via the Outer Hebrides (you can read about this in my [adventures and photography section](/adventures-photography/ "Aventures and Photography") with [part one](/adventures-photography/2014/11/JOGLE/ "John O' Groats to Lands End Part One") and [two](/adventures-photography/2014/12/JOGLE-2/ "John O' Groats to Land End Part Two")).

As a result of 235 hours and 22 minutes recorded in the saddle this year I have cycled 4,207km with 55,984m of elevation gain over the year.

Heading back into the realm of the web and software this year has seen 251 open-source contributions over numerous repositories including both my own and those of others. This is set to increase further when I get around to cleaning up much of my university work from the start of the year and open sourcing the parts that I can safely, as well as Server Observer, in January 2015 (I hope!).

## Objectives in 2015

To be clear these are *not* another set of those new-years resolutions that everyone makes and nobody archives. This just happens to be a convenient moment in time to review what I have done of late, and what I should work towards next. Call it foreword-planning.

* To complete one major bike packing loop or event. Candidates are current the Cairngorm Loop, the Highland 550 and the Bear Bones 200.
* To take and submit one carefully considered photography everyday for 365 days. I'm calling this photo365, and you can [checkout my effort on my photo365 page](/photo365 "Photo365 Challenge Page").
* To write more frequent *[notebook](/notebook "The Thoughts, Problems and Solutions of a Web Developer")* and *[adventures and photography](/adventures-photography "Adventures and dabbling with Digital Photography")* posts.
* To increase the variety in my sport, in order to help increase the photographic opportunities.
* To redesign this site to better reflect my current interests and my current projects.

If I achieve all of is in 2015 it'll be another rather good year.
