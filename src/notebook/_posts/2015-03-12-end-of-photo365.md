title: The End of Photo365
excerpt: At the end of 2014 I committed to making an attempt on a Photo365 challenge. It didn't go to plan, and here's why it wasn't a failure.

On of my [challenges this year](https://danielgroves.net/notebook/2014/12/2014-review/ "My review of 2014, featuring some challenges for the year") was to do a [Photo365 challenge](https://danielgroves.net/photo365/ "My Photo365 Challenge Attempt"). An image a day, everyday, for an entire year; how hard can it be? Very, it turns out.

The idea was that having to take a — new, fresh, and original — image everyday would help to push my photography. This was inspired by a number of things: a new camera, wanting to get out more, and wanting to take my photography up a notch.

Let's take a look at the original brief:

> For 2014 I am attempting to do the photo365 challenge. This means publishing one photo every day for a year. For this challenge I have imposed no camera restrictions (either the SLR or iPhone camera can be used) and one photo must be submitted everyday.

> Due the nature of many of the trips I do where I am unable to gain internet access some of these may be submitted a few days late, but all will have been taken on the correct day.

> The images are uploaded to Instagram and provided here by pulling those with the #photo365 hashtag from my personal feed. For immediate updates you can follow me on Instagram.

I'm behind with uploading images, but that doesn't matter. I intentionally wrote the brief to cover this, knowing I'm often away without an internet connection for periods of time. What does matter, however, is that I have missed some shots over the last week–or–so; because of this I'm calling an end to this challenge.

It's a bit frustrating failing at this challenge when I was getting along so well with it, but unfortunately being a little more towards the ill end of the scale than I'd have liked last week, and life in general being quite busy a the moment, led to a few missed shots.

Despite all of this, I've gotten exactly what I wanted out of the challenge. I'm seeing angles where before I would have ignored the sights around me — some of the shots I have taken and uploaded have even gained a reasonable number of [*likes* on Instagram](https://instagram.com/danielsgroves/p/zRw424TfbE/ "A reasonably popular waterfall shoot from February 2015").

The important thing now is to keep shooting just as much, and looking just as much. Now that I'm not looking to take one a day to publish and share some level of pressure is removed, and with that the need to share the worse images. Now I can focus on shooting the best possible photographs, and share only those that I feel are up-to-standard.
