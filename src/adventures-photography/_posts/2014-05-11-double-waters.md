I've not posted anything new recently due to working on [finishing my degree](/notebook/2014/05/finishing-university/ "Thoughts on the last four years at University"), resulting in having very little time to play bikes and cameras. Having finished last Friday afternoon, however, I spent today with two friends (Luke Shackleton and James Mandall) riding bikes and playing with cameras on a *Double Waters* loop. Unfortunately due to the rather foul weather the camera had to spend most of the day hidden away in my bag, but for a brief moment on the main descent the sun did appear.

For anyone interested in the route, follow National Cycle Network route 27 out of Plymouth to Yelverton, and the cut across the moor to Bymore Wood, where the main single-track areas descend to and follow the River Walkham. You will require OS Map *OL 28 Dartmoor*.
